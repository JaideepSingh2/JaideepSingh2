# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jaideep Singh

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about **cybersecurity** and **cloud computing**.  
Currently exploring **AI** and working on a `Chess_AI_Project`, where I'm integrating cloud technologies to make it a **multiplayer online game**.

ðŸ§  I enjoy learning how different technologies intersect and building real-world, scalable solutions.
